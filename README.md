The initial version of these files, to be found at http://svn.clinrisk.co.uk/opensource/qrisk2, faithfully implements QRISK3-2017.

ClinRisk Ltd. have released this code under the GNU Lesser General Public License to enable others to implement the algorithm faithfully.

However, the nature of the GNU Lesser General Public License is such that we cannot prevent, for example, someone accidentally altering the coefficients, getting the inputs wrong, or just poor programming.

Inaccurate implementations of risk scores can lead to wrong patients being given the wrong treatment.
